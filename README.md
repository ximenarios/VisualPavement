Deep networks for pavement distress detection and classification
To maintain a road infrastructure in good condition, periodic evaluations are needed to determine its status and plan appropriate intervention actions. The road evaluation contains tests of the surface condition, which can be performed manually or automatically. The objective of this research work is to propose a methodology for the automatic classification of surface faults in flexible pavements.
