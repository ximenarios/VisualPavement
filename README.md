# Pavement distress detection and Classification
To maintain a road infrastructure in good condition, periodic evaluations are needed to determine its status and plan appropriate intervention actions. The road evaluation contains tests of the surface condition, which can be performed manually or automatically. The objective of this research work is to propose a methodology for the automatic classification of surface faults in flexible pavements.

# Surface distress in asphalt pavement
There is no universal system to identify surface distress, the classification of the types of distress is done in comparison with the manuals developed by different institutions. In this investigation, the classification of the deteriorations is carried out in accordance with what is established in Colombia by the National Road Institute (INVIAS). INVIAS has adopted the VIZIR methodology as a tool to assess the condition of asphalt pavement deterioration through technical standard E - 813 (INVIAS, 2013), this standard considers two categories of deterioration: Type A (structural) and type B (functional). Table 1 presents a list of deficiencies and their identification code.
